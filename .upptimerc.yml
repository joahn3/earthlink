  introTitle: "**Upptime** is the open-source uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by GitHub."
  introMessage: This is a status page which uses **real-time** data from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/upptime/upptime).
  ## ‚≠ê How it works
    - GitHub Actions is used as an uptime monitor
    - Every 5 minutes, a workflow visits your website to make sure it's up
    - Response time is recorded every 6 hours and committed to git
    - Graphs of response time are generated every day
    - GitHub Issues are used for incident reports
    - An issue is opened if an endpoint is down
    - People from your team are assigned to the issue
    - Incidents reports are posted as issue comments
    - Issues are locked so non-members cannot comment on them
    - Issues are closed automatically when your site comes back up
    - Slack notifications are sent on updates
    - GitHub Pages are used for the status website
    - A simple, beautiful, and accessible PWA is generated
    - Built with Svelte and Sapper
    - Fetches data from this repository using the GitHub API
